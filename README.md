# Package Info

This package provides functions to gather and concatenate NBA Draft data ("get_draft()"). It also has a function to add information based on the athletes' senior years of college ("add_colleges()"). The latter function assumes a player's senior season was the same year in which they were drafted, which may not have always been the case.
